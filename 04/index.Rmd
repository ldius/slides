for discussion of the educational system as a major force in the language subordination system.

1. How does the content of this video illustrate the language subordination process?

presents African American English as being “improper” English
Garrard McClendon criticizes parents and teachers for not correcting the “improper” aspects of AAVE that children use
McClendon warns the children that interviewers will be listening to the way they speak, which could affect their future employment, thus making the argument that AAVE is not appropriate for formal contexts such as job interviews (students accept this argument, one  girls shows she believes in the standard language ideology that devalues her language variety)

2. Chapter 6 discusses two main reasons to justify teaching *SAE to schoolchildren. 
What are those two arguments, and which one does Garrard McClendon support?

main argument is based on economic factors. 
Supporters of this argument believe students must master \*SAE in order to be able to get a good job and prosper economically. 
The other main argument based on idea that non-\*SAE dialects are deficient, so children need to be taught \*SAE so they can think clearly. 
McClendon is focused on the first argument. 
He encourages African American students to study and use \*SAE grammar so they won't slip through the cracks of the economy because of their speech.

# Arguement from teacher supporting *SAE

.content-box-red[
.large[
"Student A must give up her home language in certain situations for her own good. This doesn’t mean she has to give it up completely; there’s no reason to deny that language; instead, redirect the student's use of that language to those environments and circumstances in which it is appropriate. At the same time, give the student another language (*SAE) – for those situations in which it will be the only socially acceptable language. This is necessary if she is to pursue a career or education in the wider world where potential employers would otherwise reject her because of the variety of English she speaks."

"All of us who speak English speak different varieties of English depending on whom we are communicating with, the circumstances involved, the purpose of the exchange, and other factors. Indeed, creative and communicative powers are enhanced when students develop and maintain multiple language competencies.
Nonetheless, some varieties of English are more useful than others for higher education, for employment, and for participation in what the Conference on College Composition and Communication (1993) in a language policy statement calls “the language of wider communication.” Therefore, while we respect diversity in spoken and written English, we believe that all students should learn this language of wider communication."

It’s our job to teach them language – to make up for their deficiency. And, since their parents don’t really know any language either, why should we waste time on Spanish? It is “good” English which has to be the focus."

discussion of the representation of African Americans in the Disney film The Frog Prince.

Discussion questions

1. Based on the reporting in this clip and what you have learned in Chapter 7, in what ways has Disney’s representation of African Americans changed? In what ways has Disney’s approach remained the same?

POSITIVE CHANGE
Does this movie indicate a positive change for Disney? 
The heroine is African American and uses AAVE pronunciations, which breaks the pattern of \*SAE- speaking heroines in previous movies. 
hero/love interest is not Anglo, which is very unusual in Disney movies. 

NEGATIVE
main character was originally going to be a maid rather than a restaurant server. 
Tiana does use AAVE pronunciations, she does not use any grammatical constructions of AAVE, which perhaps sends the message to children that AAVE varieties that are closest to \*SAE are acceptable, but varieties that are further from *SAE are not.

2. What do you think about Disney’s decision to have a Brazilian prince instead of an African American prince in this movie?

interracial relationship in a Disney movie to show kids that there is nothing wrong with interracial relationships.
But What are their motives? 
What about their choice of accent for the prince? 
What about stereotypes of sexy, steamy, Brazilian men?
