# What are we going to do?

.pull-left[

- We look at the relationships between language varieties and prejudice and their real-world consequences, such as discrimination in education, housing, careers, healthcare, interactions with the justice system, etc.

- Research and methodologies from linguistics, sociology, and psychology provide students with the terms and tools to describe, analyze, and respond to linguistic prejudice

- Reflect on our own beliefs and behaviors, interview others about their attitudes, and work together to develop potential techniques to reduce the pervasiveness of linguistic prejudice and mitigate its effects.
