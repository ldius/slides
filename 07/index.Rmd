# Warmup

- Write down one prescriptive rule violation (or a prescriptive rule) that bothers you. 
Make an argument attacking or defending the "rule" or "violation"

- Think of any ways that English is changing. 
For example, do you parents or grandparents speak differently than you? 
Find examples at every level (phonological, morphological, syntactic, semantic, lexical, etc). 
What makes the speech of your generation unique? Are these changes are bad, good, or neutral?

- Have you ever been corrected on your grammar? 
How did that make you feel? 
If you have children (or plan on having children), do/would you correct their children on that same grammatical issue? 
Do/would you correct them on any language use? 
What do you think is most important to correct and why?
