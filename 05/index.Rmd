# About the reading

.Large[
.pull-left[
- According to Strangor (2009) what limitations have probably prevented the field of Social Psychology from advancing/effecting as much social change as one might like? 
In what ways can one do more?

- Define prejudice.

- Define stereotype. Are all stereotypes bad? Explain.
]
]

???

Prejudice: a negative attitude toward a group or toward members of the group.

Stereotype: 
  1. knowledge structures that serve as mental 'pictures' of the groups in question
  2. the traits that come to mind quickly when we think about the groups

# Speech perception

### Big questions

.Large[

- How do we distinguish between speech and noise?

- How do we extract relevant information from a weak signal?

]

--
class: inverse

### Lack of invariance problem

.Large[
- Speech sounds are never pronounced exactly the same

- If I say **taco** [ˈta.ko] 10x, it is never exactly the same (acoustically)

- How are we able to relate sound with a concept of a phoneme?

# Categorical perception

.Large[
- "Equal sized physical differences are not equal sized psychologically."

- We don't perceive continua as continua...

- Within category differences are minimized

- Between category differences are maximized, exagerated

# Measurement

### What ways does the chapter describe for measuring prejudice/stereotypes? <br>Give examples in each of these areas: 

.Large[
- Self-report

- Nonreactive, indirect, or unobtrusive measures

- Physiological and neurological measures

]
]

.pull-right[

.Large[

]
]
]

???

- Self-report
  - thought listings 
  - trait check-offs 
  - probability judgments 
  - Likert scales
- Nonreactive, indirect, or unobtrusive behavioral measures
  - seating distance (Macrae et al., 1994) 
  - "implicit" reaction time measures
- Physiological and neurological measures
  - mapping out brain regions

!!not always clear that newer measures tell us more about the core social constructs of stereotyping and prejudice than older measures!!

tend to measure using whatever technology is most current

# IAT

.pull-left[
- With a partner, go to  
https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/selectatest.html  
and take an IAT test

- Choose whichever seems most (or least) interesting to you

- Focus on how it is designed, how it works, not on your responses (don't worry about what it tells you at the end)

- Take turns completing sections of the test

- Report to your group the test you did and your thoughts

- What are the positives and negatives of IAT tests?
]

.pull-right[
- According to the research presented in Strangor (2009), what is the outlook for reducing stereotyping and prejudice?

# The sociolinguistic interview

.Large[
- What is TSI?

- why was the sociolinguistic interview developed? Why is it important?

- What kinds of questions can TSI answer?

- What do sociolinguists mean when they refer to vernacular? 
What is it and why is it important? 
What problems does it pose?

- What is the 'observer's paradox' and what problems does it pose for TSI?
]

???

"methodology developed within the Labovian variationist paradigm with the goal of systematically eliciting variation across contextual styles for use as the primary evidence for sociolinguistic stratification and linguistic change"

TSI constructed to provide evidence of socially stratified sociolinguistic variation of a speech community and of linguistic change in progress
(the community pattern is ultimately of interest, not the speech patterns of the individual)

Recordings are played to listeners, who then share opinions about the voices they heard. 
The recordings differ in specific ways (one in Spanish and one in English, or in two different regional accents). 
Listener reactions (theoretically) indicate something about how the listeners view the language forms in question.

# Let's try

### In groups

1. Download Praat and open it
2. Make a recording saying...
	- toot
	- teet
3. Measure formant frequencies (F1, F2) of the vowel for each word
4. Do it for each person in your group and write down the numbers
5. Once you've finished, bring me the numbers
