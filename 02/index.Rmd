# Written language and spoken language are different

# Variation is everywhere

---

# Variation is intrinsic to all spoken language at every level

1. Language internal pressures, arising in part from the mechanics of production and perception.
2. External influences on language, such as geographic mobility and social behavior subject to normative and other formative social pressures.
3. Variation arising from language as a creative vehicle of free expression.

# Quotable

---

"linguists are outnumbered by prescriptivists, and outgunned, too. Prescriptivists are in a position to broadcast their opinions from positions of authority granted to them automatically, whereas linguists are confined to university settings and conferences. This makes it possible for prescriptivists to simply ignore – or mock – what linguists have to say about language. They make full use of this advantage and that is unlikely to change, ever."

---

"Asking a linguist how many languages they speak is like asking a doctor how many diseases they have."
