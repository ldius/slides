"**We can choose to be polite or obtuse, to use forms of address which will flatter or insult, to use gender-neutral language or language that is inflammatory; we can consciously use vocabulary which is easily understood, or we can purposefully mislead with language.**"

- What are some dimensions of language which are not subject to conscious or direct control?

- Is language like height and weight? What does Lippi-Green mean here.

Talk about stages of language (universals)

All normally developing humans progress through similar stages of speech, regardless of the language

This is a photograph of my daughter Alicia
At the time she was about 8 months old

- Pre-linguistic stage, recognize speech sounds
- produce syllables (babbling stage)
- Holophrastic stage, first words
- Two-word stage
- Telegraphic stage (multiple words)
- Multi-word stage
- acquire more difficult sounds
- Full grammar by 8

# Other big ideas...

# Other big ideas...

### All spoken languages are equal in linguistic terms

.Large[
- What are the arguments for and against this claim?
]

### Grammaticality does not equal communicative effectiveness

.Large[
- Explain
]

### Written language and spoken language are different

.Large[
- There is often an extreme disconnect between pronunciation and written form, e.g., knight [naɪt]. Why?
]

???

Language change is constant and unavoidable. 
Orthography is more set in stone... so much that it lags centuries behind change in spoken language.

# Variation is everywhere

# Variation is intrinsic to all spoken language at every level

.Large[
1. Language internal pressures, arising in part from the mechanics of production and perception.
2. External influences on language, such as geographic mobility and social behavior subject to normative and other formative social pressures.
3. Variation arising from language as a creative vehicle of free expression.

Listen to these recordings. What types of variation do you notice?
Where are these people from? What can you infer about age, gender, class, etc.?

## .black["].grey[[...]linguists are outnumbered by prescriptivists, and outgunned, too. Prescriptivists are in a position to broadcast their opinions from positions of authority granted to them automatically, whereas linguists are confined to university settings and conferences. This makes it possible for prescriptivists to simply ignore – or mock – what linguists have to say about language. They make full use of this advantage and that is unlikely to change, ever.].black["]

- Ask five people you don't know well why the above sentence is "wrong" to say 
- Do not react to their response, and don't engage in conversation. 
- Concentrate on taking notes. 
- Report your findings in [OD1](https://rutgers.instructure.com/courses/211354/discussion_topics/2759282) by next Thursday at 5pm
- Read your classmates' responses and compare the answers you received to theirs 
- Similarities? Differences? Does gender or age make a difference?
