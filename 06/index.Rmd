What does it aim to do?

- What is a crucial claim of those that partake in racialized science? 

- According to racialized science, what explains the disproportionate representation of some "racial" groups among lower socioeconomic tiers?

]

???

Racialized science emphasizes identifying immutable differences between racial groups in order to maintain and reinforce existing racial inequality

Racialized scientists claim that no degree of government intervention or social change will alter the skills and abilities of different racial groups

Disproportionate representation is an unavoidable byproduct of human evolution

Purpose of article is to "examine the origins of the concept of race, placing the contemporary discussion of racial differences in an anthropological and historical context"

1. Listen to the samples from African American speakers from several states. 
Do you notice any variation in the varieties of AAVE used by these speakers?

2. Listen to the samples of other dialects of English other than AAVE and consult the description of some features of AAVE provided on page 183. 
Do you hear any of those features in the non-AAVE dialects?

factually incorrect assumptions. 
Black children learn AAVE not from television actors and sports figures (as Greene surmises), but in their homes, as their first and native variety of U.S. English. 

More importantly, Greene assumes that the only role models that African American children have are these sports and entertainment individuals, and further, that a good role model will not sound Black.

Lippi-Green talks about the selective appropriation of AAVE lexical items into other varieties of English.

Can you think of any examples of this?

# It is not the Black child’s language which is despised: It is his experience.

### .right[James Baldwin, "Nobody knows my name" (1985b)]

In line with general view that discrimination against the language of somebody is discrimination against the person

# It has been established that AAVE has a rule-governed grammar. As this is the case for all living languages, it could be said that grammar is inevitable, and resistance is futile. To ignore this fact about AAVE is to demonstrate ignorance, condescension and disrespect.

### PR2

- What misconceptions did you have about AAVE before you began reading this chapter? 
Do you think the readings/discussions will have any long-term effect on your beliefs and reactions?
- What types of public figures do you think use AAVE the most on television (e.g. politicians, actors, athletes, musicians, writers, newscasters, etc.)? 
Why do you think some groups use AAVE more than others?
- Take notes on any use of AAVE while you watch TV over a set time period.
Note who uses AAVE, as well as the context of the utterance and some general information about what features of AAVE were used. 
For example, did the speaker use general intonational features, pronunciations, or grammatical features of AAVE? 
Can you find any patterns in your data? 
Reflect on what you found and how you think your findings reflect standard language ideology.


### **PR1 should be no more than 1-2 pages typed (word document, double spaced, 12pt font). You do not need to include references or cite sources.**
