- In general, what stereotypes do you associate with the South?

- What does Southern speech sound like?

- Can you distinguish between different accents of the South? Which?

- What is overt prestige? 
How does it differ from covert prestige? 
Give examples.

# Get to know the South

### Listen to some of the clips of Southern English. Can you hear the regional variation? Can you tell which region of the South these dialects are from? Do you think some dialects more strongly devalued than others? Which ones do you think would be most accepted by outsiders? Why do you think that is?

Nora Norules, a young attorney, worked for a law firm in a large city. With hair like spun gold and eyes like wild violets, she favored traditional business suits.
One day Ms. Merry Erudite, a client, said to Bob, a senior law partner, “When your new attorney speaks, her looks fall off her. In fact, your firm begins to look shabby after she utters a few sentences. Bob, she wouldn’t know an irregular verb if it bit her on the elbow. She says, for example, ‘I have went,’ and she doesn’t know she’s made a glaring mistake.”
“I know, but what can we do? She is, after all, a brilliant attorney,” said Bob.

Merry said, “She also says ‘have ran’ and ‘has broke.’ I suggest that each time one of your employees says, ‘I have went,’ you pull out a stun gun, and let ’em have it. Then stress proper usage by repeating, ‘I have gone. I had gone. He has gone. They have gone.’ Maybe they’ll get the idea and remember to replace went with gone when using helping verbs.”

Dolly Withrow, a retired English professor, taught at West Virginia State University for 16 years... She is the author of four books, including The Confident Writer, a grammar-based writing textbook for college students and writers in general. A columnist for The Charleston Daily Mail and The Jackson Herald, Dolly has won national writing awards... West Virginia Public Radio broadcast her essays for three years. She is a public speaker and grammar workshop presenter.

- Discuss this with your group. 
How is this an example of Bourdieu's strategies of condescension?

- Have you ever heard someone imitate Southern English in order to mock it? 
What was the context? 
What was the message the person was sending to his or her addressees? 
What does that non-Southerner's use of Southern English reveal about his or her language ideology?

## It is absolutely wrong to discriminate on the basis of accent. However, I think this country would be much better off if everybody spoke the same language and if communication was as clear as possible... If we were all clearly communicating – this doesn’t mean behaving the same – we’d be much better off as a society. I’m not denying heritage, but I think that speech impediments make a person feel bad about him or herself. Speech differences [can foster] misinterpretations. Accents divide people.

# How well do you know the South? 

.Large[

- Write down as many non-fictional Southerners you can think of. 
They can be personal acquaintances or public figures. 

- When you're finished, go back and try to be specific about what part of the South each person comes from. 
Check your answers online for accuracy. 

- What results do you draw from this exercise? (If you are a Southerner, reverse this process and make a list of Northerners or Westerners). 

- If you are a Southerner, how much do you know about (for example) North Dakota as compared to Michigan, or Kansas compared to Idaho? 
Do you notice any linguistic differentiation? Is there differentiation that you just don't hear?

# Dear Abby

## I recently moved to the Boston area after living my whole life in Jackson, Mississippi. It has been two years, but I'm is still not used to people laughing in my face and mocking my accent. I don't understand why people find this not only acceptable, but amusing. I'd like to know how best to respond when I come across this behavior.

# Where are we now?

.pull-left[

In this chapter, the popular entertainment examples that contribute to southern stereotypes are dated. 
You may not know who Lil’ Abner is, and you may never have seen an episode of The Beverley Hillbillies. 

- Does this indicate to you a decline in southern stereotypes? 
- If not, where are the current day stereotypes to be found? 
- How were your beliefs and opinions about the South (or the North) formed?

# Quotable

class: middle, center

## I got an interview with an extremely elite undergraduate college in the Northeast. They conducted the first substantial part of the interview in [another language] and it went well. When they switched to a question in English, my first answer completely interrupted the interview... they broke out laughing for quite a while. I asked what was wrong and they said they “never would have expected” me to have such an accent. They made a big deal about me having a [prestigious accent in the second language] and such a strong Southern accent. Of course, I had been aiming for bland Standard American English. After that, I got a number of questions about whether I’d “be comfortable” at their institution. Subtle, but to me it was not ambiguous.
