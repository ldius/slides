# Warmup

.pull-left[

- What's one prescriptive rule/violation that bothers you? 
Make an argument attacking or defending the "rule" or "violation".

- Think of ways English is changing. 
For example, do you parents or grandparents speak differently than you? 
Find phonological, morphological, syntactic, semantic, lexical, etc. examples.
Why is the speech of your generation unique? Is it bad, good, or neutral?

- Have you ever been corrected on your grammar? 
How did that make you feel? 
If you have children (or plan to), do/would you correct them on the same issue? 
Do/would you correct them on any language use? 
What is/isn't important to correct and why?

# What is an accent? 

.pull-left[
.Large[
- What is an accent? 
Were you surprised by the meaning (for the lay person and for linguists) when reading this chapter? 
What are the differences between an L1 accent and an L2 accent?

- Why is learning an L2 hard? What is the role of age? 

- What is a dialect? What is the issue with this term? What are some synonyms for this term?

- Discuss your understanding of these terms. 
- How are they related? What are the differences between them?

# Something to think about

.pull-left[
.large[
- If *SAE is something logically and reasonably required of broadcast news reporters, why was it required of James Kahakua, and not of Peter Jennings (Canada) or Dan Rathers (Texas)?

- And, a more difficult question: what is right or wrong about asking Mr. Kahakua to pretend? 

- If he is capable of faking an accent, why shouldn't his employer ask him to do this, for those few minutes he is reading the weather on the radio?

# The "Sound House"

.pull-left[
.large[
- Lippi Green presents a powerful analogy of the Sound House. Explain this to your group to the best of your ability. Does the Sound House example make sense in the context of your linguistic experience? How many sound houses do you have? Have you/can you change yours? Explain. 

- What does the idea of style shifting do to the Sound House analogy? Many people are multilingual, and for each language they also have multiple styles. Is there a way to adapt the metaphor to account for this?

# The standard language myth

### Consider these two statements:

.Large[
1. The fact that a word appears in a dictionary means \_\_\_\_\_.
2. The fact that a word does not appear in a dictionary means \_\_\_\_\_.
]

### Can you come up with clear, consistent and factually accurate ways to finish these thoughts? If not, why not?

.pull-left[
.large[
Think of 5 words that you know and/or use that are not in the dictionary, and then find 5 words that are in the dictionary but are totally unfamiliar to you. 
]
]

.pull-right[
.large[
Compare and contrast these two sets of words. 
Why do you think the totally unfamiliar words are in the dictionary while the commonly used words are not?

# Personal reflection 1

.pull-left[

- Interview some friends or family (a group of three or four people) and try to elicit how they feel about different varieties of English and different L2 accents. 
- Discuss the myth of \*SAE by asking them to define it and give examples of who speaks it.
- Take notes. On what do they agree? Where do they differ?
- Can you account for the differences, or lack of differences? What surprised you?
- What accents do you personally dislike or find irritating? 
- Describe a situation in which you reacted this way to a variety of English other than your own. 
- After everything we've seen so far in this class, do you have any insight into your own reactions?
